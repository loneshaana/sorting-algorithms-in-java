1.Degree of the vertex is the number of the edges incident on it.
2.A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex
3.If a graph is not connected then it consists of a set of connected components.
4.Spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all the vertices and is a single tree.
5.A biparitite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two sets such tat all edges connect a vertex
    in one set with a vertex in the other set.
6.Graphs with all edges present are called complete graphes.
